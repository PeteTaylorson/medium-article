        <h2>Paris, France -</h2>
        <p>
          A groundbreaking new study has definitively concluded that Jean-Pierre Dubois of Paris is the most tedious and monotonous human being on Earth.
          Mr. Dubois, a 42-year-old accountant, achieved the highest score ever recorded on the Boredom Quotient Analysis, a rigorous scientific examination that rates an individual's capacity to induce extreme lethargy and stupefaction in others.

        <h2>"Supernaturally Boring"</h2>
        <p>
          Researchers closely observed Mr. Dubois as he went about his daily routine, which included activities like alphabetizing his sock drawer, listening to French tax law podcasts, and watching paint dry. "It was the most mind-numbingly dull thing we've ever witnessed,"
          said lead researcher Dr. Pierre LeSnooze. "Mr. Dubois possesses an almost supernatural ability to sap the life force out of anyone in his vicinity."

        <p>
          The new ranking confirms what Mr. Dubois' few acquaintances have long suspected: that he is peerlessly tiresome. "I'd rather watch grass grow than spend 5 minutes with Jean-Pierre," said longtime co-worker Jeanette Besoin. "He could make a NASCAR race seem totally coma-inducing."
          When informed of his new title, Mr. Dubois paused for several minutes before finally responding, "Oh, that's nice I suppose."
          Researchers hope to reconnect with him soon for a more detailed interview, if they can manage to stay awake.

        <h2></h2>
        <p>
          In addition to being exceptionally boring, Mr. Dubois was known for his almost cartoonish stupidity. Friends and family say he frequently forgot his own name, often wore mismatched shoes, and was bamboozled by tasks as simple as using a can opener.
          He once called the fire department to rescue his car after he locked his keys inside it, not realizing he could simply unlock the passenger door. "Jean-Pierre wasn't just dull, he was a true dimwit," said sister Carole Dubois.
          "I swear you could almost see the vacant look in his eyes as you spoke to him. The man barely had two brain cells to rub together."
        </p>

        <h2>A Surpisingly Long Innings</h2>
        <p>
          Tragically, Mr. Dubois passed away after forgetting to breathe while reading an instruction manual for his refrigerator. Authorities believe he was so utterly bored by the material that he simply did not notice his lack of oxygen. Authorities,
          who believe he was so utterly dumb that he simply did not notice his lack of oxygen, are not surprised that in the end, Mr. Dubois essentially forgot how to perform the basic bodily function of respiration.

        <h2>A Stupid Way To Die</h2>
        <p>
          "It was a stupid way to die, but a fitting one for him," commented a police spokesperson, "We're just amazed he lived this long." Mr. Dubois had several previous brushes with death thanks to his unparalleled boringness and stupidity.
          Last year, he nearly drowned in a kiddie pool after dozing off while watching a documentary on mollusks. In the end, Mr. Dubois departed this world as he lived - in the most banal and asinine way imaginable.
